                  How Does VFX Rotoscoping Work?
                </h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                In the process of VFX rotoscoping, a new alpha channel has to be
                created for a specific video sequence. This complete task is
                done by a rotoscoping artist who actually uses the set of
                animation tools to make it done within a time frame to trace the
                object radically. Also, in this process, the footage is only
                taken from a camera that doesn’t have any alpha channel to make
                it more startling. Furthermore, after tracing the elements in
                the video, there will be a need to create an alpha mask
                manually. The creation of the alpha mask will be done by the
                rotoscope artist and he also animates other forms around the
                object. This process will be done to conform the motion on each
                platform. If there is any difficulty in the shot, it might take
                hours or more days to get accomplished. At the time of creating
                the best visual effects in a video, rotoscoping is the best way
                to make it done. On the other hand, there might be the usage of
                blue and green displays that makes it much easier to arrange
                different elements in the scene.
